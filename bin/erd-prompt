database for thesisboard should include?
- this system is "ThesisBoard: A Node.js and React Web-Based Platform for Managing Pre-Thesis and Thesis Project" which is only for CSE faculty meaning that the faculty here is the system which means there is only 1 department.
- users also have key things in a product such as notification, announcement
- student entity should include basic info, student id, gpa and credits number (accumulate at current semester)
- student username is student id while admin, moderator and teacher usernames are given.
- each semester, student data is added by mod which means there is semester entity.
- authN, authZ is manage by using third party Auth0 (Role-Based Authentication and Authorization with Auth0)
- the project is the single-student project
- Tech stack: MySQL/Sequelize/Nodejs/TypeScript/Auth0

users: admin, moderator, teacher, student
admin: highest priority to manage the whole systems, dashboard etc
moderator: for faculty staffs, to manage academic activities
teacher: acts like a teacher in thesis and pre-thesis activities. with pre-thesis, teacher as a supervisor is available to give topics based on given slots, accepts registrations, give grade to pre-thesis project. with thesis, teachers can be supervisors, reviewers or committee members( who conduct the final defense for the thesis ); thesis supervisors submit students' registration of the thesis (registration through mail of available teachers, those teachers who is available, their contact info will be given, student contact them out there then teacher submit registration form), give grade for thesis; reviewer is added to thesis by moderator, available to review and then give grade; committee members give grade after final defense. supervisor or reviewer can also be a member in committee
student: pre-thesis students register the available given topics in the list of topics of all teachers. thesis student can be registered and added to thesis if teacher submit registration for the faculty. in the project, they submit materials. be careful at pre-thesis and thesis permissions.

deeply thinking and helps me write out the ERD for the system with logically and widely applied methods for realworld product.
